<h1 align="center">Hiya 💫 <br>
I'm Camille!</h3>

I'm an astrophysicist at the Institute of Astronomy of KU Leuven, Belgium.
- I study binary stars and stellar winds through hydrodynamics simulations.
- I’m currently working on porting [MACE](https://github.com/silkemaes/MACE) to [Phantom](https://github.com/danieljprice/phantom) to solve chemistry in 3D simulations of stellar winds 🌟
- Ask me about stars, hydro simulations, and miniature painting 🖌️
- Pronouns: They/them 🏳️‍🌈

Also, I doodle a lot in my spare time~
