## Hiya 💫
### I'm Camille!

I'm an astrophysicist at KU Leuven, Belgium.
- I study binary stars and stellar winds through hydrodynamics simulations.
-  I’m currently working on porting [MACE](https://github.com/silkemaes/MACE) to [Phantom](https://github.com/danieljprice/phantom) to solve chemistry in 3D simulations of stellar winds 🌟
-  Ask me about stars, hydro simulations, and miniature painting 🖌️
-  Pronouns: They/them 🏳️‍🌈
